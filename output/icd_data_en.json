MDMA is methylene-dioxymethamphetamine and is a common drug of abuse in many countries especially among young people. It is predominantly available in tablet form known as ‘ecstasy’. Pharmacologically, MDMA has stimulant and empathogenic properties and these encourage its use among young people for social and other interactions. Considering its wide prevalence in many countries and among many sub-groups of young people, MDMA and Related Drug Dependence and MDMA and Related Drug Withdrawal are comparatively uncommon. Substance-Induced Mental Disorders may arise from its use. Several analogues of MDMA exist, including MDA (methylene-dioxyamphetamine)."},"classKind":"category","browserUrl":"https://icd.who.int/browse/2023-01/mms/en#1218193465","code":"6C4C","Children":null},{"title":{"@value":"Disorders due to use of dissociative drugs including ketamine and phencyclidine [PCP]"},"definition":{"@value":"Disorders due to use of dissociative drugs including ketamine and phencyclidine [PCP] are characterised by the pattern and consequences of dissociative drug use.

Ketamine is an intravenous anaesthetic widely used in low- and middle-income countries, particularly in Africa, and in emergency situations. Ketamine is also undergoing evaluation for treatment of some mental disorders (e.g., treatment resistant Depressive Disorders). It is also a widespread drug of nonmedical use in many countries and may be taken by the oral or nasal routes or injected. It produces a sense of euphoria but depending on the dose, emergent hallucinations and dissociation are recognised as unpleasant side effects. Phencyclidine has a more restricted worldwide distribution and also has euphoric and dissociative effects. Its use may result in bizarre behaviour uncharacteristic for the individual, including self-harm. Dissociative Drug Dependence is described but a withdrawal syndrome is not recognized by most authorities.
